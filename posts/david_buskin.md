I first encountered Buskin and Batteau opening for Steve Forbert at the Capital Theater in Passaic New Jersey.      

My friends and I had a practice called "splitting records" between my cadre of friends.  Somebody would buy a record and I'd chip in and go over to Aaron's and we'd tape them onto cassette with his Dad's out of this world Nakamichi tape deck.  I know vinyl of this record ended in Robert's collection.

I have a few standard searches that I launch on a semi-regular basis, mostly all having to do with 
music.  I was tickled to come across this YouTube video.
