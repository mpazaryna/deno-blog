I first encountered Buskin and Batteau opening for somebody at the Capital Theater in the late 70's
opening for Steve Forbert.  At the time I was (and still am) an aspiring guitar player.  In those days
I had Yamaha acoustic guitar and took lessons at Loria Music in Clark.  I remember learning how to 
play Take it Easy and Prove It All Night.    

We had a practice called "splitting records" between my cadre of friends.  Somebody would buy a record 
and I'd chip in and go over to Aaron's and we'd tape them onto cassette with his Dad's out of this 
world Nakamichi tape deck.  I know the original vinyl of the David Buskin record ended in Robert's 
collection.

I have a few standard searches that I launch on a semi-regular basis, mostly all having to do with 
music.  I was tickled to come across this YouTube video.  It seems the record is out of print and
not available on the streaming services.
